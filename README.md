# IML Tests Repository 
Tests for IML course @ HUJI 2023

Welcome to my IML Tests Repository! 🦾

This is where I publish the tests for our home exercises as part of the Introduction to Machine Learning course at the Hebrew University in 2023.

My goal is to create simple, understandable tests that are easy to debug, so you can use them to test and debug your own code.
